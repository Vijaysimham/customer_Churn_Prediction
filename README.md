# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses such as telecom companies. When customers stop using a service, it leads to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.

This project builds a **machine learning model to predict customer churn** using telecom customer data. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can implement proactive retention strategies.

---

## Business Problem

Customer retention is significantly cheaper than acquiring new customers. Predicting which customers are likely to leave allows companies to take preventive actions such as:

- Personalized offers
- Improved customer support
- Service upgrades
- Loyalty programs

This project uses machine learning to analyze customer behavior and predict churn probability.

---

## Dataset

Dataset used: **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**

The dataset contains information about telecom customers including:

- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Services subscribed
- Billing details
- Customer tenure

### Target Variable

```
Churn (Yes / No)
```

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Removed unnecessary columns (`customerID`)
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric format
- Handled missing values
- Prepared the dataset for machine learning models

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis was performed to understand patterns influencing churn.

Key visualizations include:

- Churn distribution
- Contract type vs churn
- Monthly charges vs churn
- Tenure vs churn
- Feature correlation analysis

---

### 3. Feature Engineering

A new feature was created to represent customer value.

```
TotalSpend = MonthlyCharges × Tenure
```

This feature estimates the total amount a customer has spent during their subscription period.

---

### 4. Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps include:

- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

---

### 5. Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Training multiple models allows comparison of performance and identification of the best algorithm.

---

## Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score

| Model | Accuracy |
|------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | ~80% |
| Random Forest | ~84% |
| XGBoost | ~86% |

The **XGBoost model** achieved the best performance.

## Explainable AI using SHAP

To understand how the model makes predictions, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** was used.

SHAP helps explain:

- Which features influence churn predictions
- How each feature contributes to model decisions

Key churn drivers identified:

- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Internet service
- Total spend

---

## Key Business Insights

Analysis of the data revealed several important insights:

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts churn more frequently**
- Customers with **shorter tenure have higher churn probability**
- Higher **monthly charges increase churn risk**
- Customers without **online security or technical support services** tend to churn more often

These insights can help companies design better customer retention strategies.
